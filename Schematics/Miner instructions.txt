Mines the selected ore and deposits it to the linked storage.  Units can mine much larger quantities than drills from just one ore tile. One quasar produces 75% of an air blast drill and needs no power, water or conveyors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         INSTRUCTIONS:     1. Enter unit type and number of units.     2. Units bound have to be within maxDistance. If you want units nearby to be bound, move them near the processor and set this to a smaller distance. If you don't care, set this to 0.     3. Idle units will be released and unflagged after releaseWaitSecs expire. Set this to a high number if you expect that your container will be often full.     4. Units will autolocate ore. If you do not like the default ore location, set useSetCoords to true and enter oreX and oreY.    5. Select ore from sorter to start. Select nothing to turn off.  Turn off and on to reset.   6. If sorter turns red, check the error variable.
                                                         NOTES: Miner might start slowly if there are lots of your selected unit type on the map. After startup, it should be fast.                                                                                                    UPDATE: Fix for instabilities with startup and restart. Updated error handling.                                                 Ping @freakymouse with error reports.
