Mines the selected ore and deposits it to the linked storage.  If nothing is linked, deposits to core. Autolocates nearest ore to drop target. Flags the number of selected units. When turned off, it will unflag after 30 seconds. All of these are configurable at the top of the code.                                                                                                                                                                                                          INSTRUCTIONS: Place away from core if you want miners to deposit to linked storage.  Select ore from sorter. Enter unit type and number of units in the processor.  If you do not like the default ore location, set useSetCoords to true and enter oreX and oreY.                                      ERROR HANDLING: Turn off and on to re-link or re-flag. If sorter turns red, check the error variable.
