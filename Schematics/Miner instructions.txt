Mines the selected ore and deposits it to the linked storage.  If nothing is linked, deposits to core. Autolocates nearest ore to drop target. Flags the number of selected units. Built in error handling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                INSTRUCTIONS:     1. Enter unit type and number of units in the processor.     2. Units bound have to be within maxDistance. If you want units nearby to be bound, move them near the processor and set this to a smaller distance. If you don't care, set this to 0.     3. Idle units will be released and unflagged after releaseWaitSecs expire. Set this to a high number if you expect that your container will be often full.     4. Units will autolocate ore. If you do not like the default ore location, set useSetCoords to true and enter oreX and oreY.    5. Select ore from sorter to turn on.  Turn off and on to reset.   6. If sorter turns red, check the error variable.       										                                      
NOTES: Miner might start slowly if there are lots of your selected unit type on the map. After startup, it should be fast.                                                   UPDATE: This version uses a new flagging algorithm and should be faster.
