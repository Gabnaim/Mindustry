Fast updating core stock display. 
You can put it near the core and link all four processors to core, or can put away from core. 
If away from core, you need a unit to locate core. 
Program will try to find a flare, mono, poly, mega, nova, pulsar, quasar, dagger, crawler. 
If you don't have any of those, you probably don't need this.                                  
NOTE: do not use earlier version, it is buggy. Bugs have been fixed in this version.
